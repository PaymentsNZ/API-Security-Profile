# V2.0-draft3 schemas

This folder contains schemas for the V2.0-draft3 security profile.  This includes:

* Client authentication schema (for use with `private_key_jwt` and `client_secret_jwt` authentication)
* Hybrid flow relevant schemas
* CIBA decoupled flow relevant schemas
* ID token schema
* Generic JWS header schema

These are assistive in nature, and supplementary to the Security Profile documentation.  It is highly recommended to follow that documentation first.
